# Introduction
A pure-Nim implementation of Ethash, the Ethereum proof of work

Implementation is based on the [spec revision 23 (2017-08-03)](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash).

# Mining
An unoptimized mining CPU backend is available through the compile-time flag ``-d:ethash_mining``.
It requires compilation through the C++ backend.

# Optimizations
For maximum speed, compile Ethash with `-d:release -d:march_native -d:openmp`.
This will compile Ethash in Nim release mode, with all supported CPU extensions (especially AVX2) and with OpenMP multiprocessing. On MacOS, OpenMP requires installing GCC-7 and can be done through Homebrew.

# Original implementation
Original Ethereum implementation is available [here](https://github.com/ethereum/ethash).
